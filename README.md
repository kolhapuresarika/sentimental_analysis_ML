# sentimental_analysis_ML

## 🔍 Project Overview  

Social media platforms generate huge volumes of user opinions every day. Understanding these opinions helps in identifying public perception, feedback, and trends. This project implements a **Machine Learning-based Sentiment Analysis system** that automatically classifies social media text into **positive, negative, or neutral** sentiments.

The system supports **manual text input**, **CSV file analysis**, **username-based sentiment evaluation**, and **YouTube comments sentiment analysis** with percentage visualization. Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques are used to provide accurate and meaningful sentiment insights.

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Collect and preprocess social media text data  
- Perform manual and automated sentiment analysis  
- Classify text into positive, negative, or neutral  
- Analyze sentiment based on usernames and YouTube comments  
- Display sentiment distribution in percentage form  
- Provide an interactive and user-friendly interface
- 
## ⚙️ System Approach  

### 🔹 Data Input Module  
- Manual text input  
- CSV file upload  
- Username-based data collection  
- YouTube comments extraction  

### 🔹 Data Preprocessing  
- Text cleaning and normalization  
- Tokenization  
- Stop-word removal  
- Feature extraction (TF-IDF / Bag of Words)  

### 🔹 Machine Learning Model  
- Train labeled sentiment dataset  
- Apply classification algorithms  
  - Naive Bayes  
  - Logistic Regression  
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
- Evaluate model performance  

### 🔹 Sentiment Analysis Engine  
- Predict sentiment category  
- Calculate sentiment percentages  

### 🔹 User Interface  
- Interactive Streamlit-based web dashboard  
- Graphical visualization of results  

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies  

- Python  
- Scikit-learn  
- NLTK / SpaCy  
- Pandas & NumPy  
- Streamlit  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn  
- YouTube Data API  

## 🚀 How to Use  

- Enter text manually to analyze sentiment  
- Upload a CSV file for bulk sentiment analysis  
- Enter a username to analyze user sentiment  
- Paste a YouTube video link to analyze comment sentiments  
- View sentiment results and percentage visualization  

## 📈 Results  

The system accurately classifies text into positive, negative, and neutral categories. Sentiment distribution is displayed in charts for easy understanding of public opinion.

## 🔮 Future Scope  

- Implement Deep Learning models (LSTM, BERT)  
- Real-time social media data analysis  
- Multilingual sentiment detection  
- Emotion classification beyond three categories  
- Advanced dashboard analytics  
- Mobile application integration
- 
## 📚 Conclusion
